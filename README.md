# noctwo.vim

## A Vim color scheme for 16-color terminals 
It is based on [noctu][1] and modified for my needs.


## Installation

Just stick `noctwo.vim` in your `colors/` directory, or if you manage your
plug-ins with [plug][2] or [dein][3] put this in your vimrc:
```vim
" plug
Plug 'jemaw/vim-noctwo'
```
```vim
" dein
call dein#add('jemaw/vim-noctwo')
```
